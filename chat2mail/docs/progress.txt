## March 9, 2025 - Gemini AI Integration

### Implemented Features

1. **Gemini AI Integration**:
   - Created a dedicated API route (`/api/generate-email`) for integrating with Google's Gemini Flash 2.0 model
   - Implemented proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for when the AI service is unavailable
   - Added environment variable support for securely storing the Gemini API key

2. **Enhanced Dashboard UI**:
   - Added tone and length controls to customize the generated emails
   - Improved the email generation UI with loading states and error handling
   - Added toast notifications for better user feedback

3. **Toast Notification System**:
   - Implemented a toast notification system for providing feedback to users
   - Added toast components for success, error, and informational messages

### Next Steps

1. **Email Saving and Management**:
   - Implement functionality to save generated emails to the database
   - Create a history view to see previously generated emails

2. **Email Sending Integration**:
   - Add the ability to send emails directly from the application
   - Integrate with email service providers

3. **User Preferences**:
   - Allow users to save preferred email templates and styles
   - Implement user-specific settings for the AI generation

### Technical Notes

- The Gemini Flash 2.0 model provides faster response times compared to Gemini Pro
- Environment setup requires a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the `.env.local` file
- The API route pattern allows for better security by keeping the API key on the server side

## Gemini Chat API Implementation

We've updated our email generation functionality to use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model with the chat-based API instead of the previous content generation approach. This change brings several benefits:

### Key Changes

1. **Chat-based API**: We now use a chat session with history, which allows for more contextual and conversational email generation.

2. **Improved Response Format**: We specifically instruct the model to format emails as plain text rather than JSON, which simplifies the response handling.

3. **Response Cleaning**: Added robust handling for various response formats, including the ability to extract email content from JSON responses if needed.

4. **Style Mapping**: Implemented a mapping function to convert our UI tone options to Gemini's style parameters.

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Start a chat session with history
const chatSession = model.startChat({
  generationConfig,
  history: [
    {
      role: "user",
      parts: [
        {
          text: `Generate an Email for me 
Style : ${mapToneToStyle(tone)} 
Sender : ${sender}
Title : ${senderTitle || 'N/A'}
Receiver : ${receiver}
Title : ${receiverTitle || 'N/A'}
Subject : ${subject}
${additionalContext ? `Additional Context: ${additionalContext}` : ''}
Length: ${length}`
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

// Send a message to continue the chat and get the response
const result = await chatSession.sendMessage("Please format the email as plain text, not JSON. Start with the greeting and end with the signature. The email should be well-structured with proper paragraphs and formatting.");
```

### Next Steps

- Test the new implementation with various inputs to ensure it generates high-quality emails
- Consider adding more style options and customization parameters
- Implement email history and saving functionality

## Environment Variables for Gemini AI Integration

To use the Gemini AI integration, you need to add the following environment variable to your `.env.local` file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can obtain a Gemini API key from the Google AI Studio (https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### Steps to set up Gemini AI:

1. Create an account on Google AI Studio if you don't have one
2. Generate an API key
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project
4. Add the GEMINI_API_KEY variable with your API key
5. Restart your development server

## March 11, 2025 - User Profile Display and Token Usage Metrics

### Implemented Features

   - Added better capitalization and formatting for user names in the dropdown menu
   - Fixed issues with displaying full names that were in incorrect formats
   - Added truncation to prevent overflow of long names

2. **Token Usage Metrics**:
   - Created a modular `TokenUsageDisplay` component to visualize token usage metrics
   - Updated the API route to track and return token usage data from Gemini AI
   - Implemented input, output, and total token count display with a progress bar
   - Added tooltips to explain token usage to users
   - Made the token metrics display conditionally visible and easily removable

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **User Profile Display**:
   - Enhanced the `getDisplayName` function to handle different name formats (first last, first middle last, etc.)
   - Added a `formatFullName` function to properly capitalize each word in the user's name
   - Added truncation to prevent UI issues with very long names

2. **Token Usage Metrics**:
   - Created a reusable `TokenUsageDisplay` component that can be easily integrated or removed
   - Added token usage tracking in the `/api/generate-email` API route
   - Implemented proper error handling and fallback for token metrics when the AI service is unavailable
   - Used Tailwind CSS for styling to maintain consistency with the rest of the application

### Next Steps

1. **User Profile Enhancements**:
   - Add ability for users to edit their profile information
   - Implement profile picture upload functionality
   - Add name format validation during registration

2. **Token Usage Analytics**:
   - Implement server-side storage of token usage for analytics
   - Add a dashboard for admins to monitor overall token usage
   - Implement user-specific token limits and quotas

3. **Email Generation Improvements**:
